    "Introduction\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "permittivity-calc works by storing input S-parameter data and associated processed data in a [Python Class](docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) called AirlineData. The definition of AirlineData is located in sparam_data.py. When data is input into permittivity-calc, a new instance of the AirlineData Class is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AirlineData Class contains several data attributes and methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data attributes store the raw S-parameter data, processed (complex permittivity) data, as well as variables. Some variables are mandatory such as the length of the transmission line (L), and some are optional such as the bulk density of the sample measured (bulk_density).\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are functions which either automatically process the input data, can be called to process data if an argument is given to the AirlineData Class Instance, or must be called manually. Methods are either private methods not meant to be accessed by the user or public methods meant to be used by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the class methods, permittivity-calc also has helper functions (public and private) which are used to input data (either manually or via file dialog), to plot both the permittivity data and the raw S-parameter data, and to plot multiple permittivity datasets together.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is intended to demonstrate every feature of permittivity-calc starting with basic usage and moving on to more advanced, custom, or minor features.\n",

    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",

    "- **get_METAS_data**: function used to input S-parameter data from a .txt file. Stores the data as a numpy array and determines the length of the transmission line based on the name given. Default length values in get_METAS_data are for the the GR900-LZ15 line. Can be given a custom length. The AirlineData Class expect arguments returned by get_METAS_data\n",
    "- **perm_compare**: takes a list of AirlineData Class Instances and plots them together\n",
    "- **multiple_meas**: used to open multiple files at once. Given any .txt file in a folder, will try to open all .txt files in that folder and process them as S-parameter data. Each .txt file generates its own AirlineData Class Instance and all the data are plotted together using perm_compare\n",
    "- **run_default**: the simplest way to use permittivity-calc. Calls get_METAS_data and feeds the output to the AirlineData Class\n",
